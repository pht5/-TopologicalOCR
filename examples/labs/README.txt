This directory contains a series of "laboratory exercises," written by Rann Bar-On, and beta-tested by the students
in the DataRTG summer 2014 program at Duke.

There are three labs, all found in doc/.

The first lab focuses on 0-dim persistence for sublevel-set-filtrations of single-variable functions on closed intervals (that is, signals).

The second lab works through 0-dim persistence and 1-dim for point clouds (in this case, obtatined by sliding window embeddings from signals).

The third lab is about persistent local homology.


Res/ and scripts/ contain files and functions needed to work through the labs.
